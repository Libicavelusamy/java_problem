# Java Practice Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises and projects that I have practiced, ranging from basic to advanced topics. The repository is organized by concepts and includes a wide variety of Java topics such as basic syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, multithreading, and more. This is intended to help both beginners and advanced learners in mastering Java.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a portfolio of Java exercises that I have worked on, showcasing my progress in learning Java. The examples range from simple programs to more complex ones that demonstrate advanced concepts and features of the Java language.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes Java code covering both **basic** and **advanced** topics. Below are the main areas and subtopics covered:

### Basics

- **Hello World Program**: Basic Java syntax and structure.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding primitive data types, arrays, and variable declarations.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
- **Control Flow**: If-else, switch statements, loops (for, while, do-while).
- **Methods**: Function definitions, method overloading, and recursion.
- **Basic Input/Output**: Using `Scanner` for input and `System.out` for output.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes and Objects**: Basic OOP concepts, creating classes and objects.
- **Constructors**: Understanding default and parameterized constructors.
- **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, etc.) and getter/setter methods.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes, method overriding, and the `super` keyword.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and method overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: Use of getters and setters for data protection.
- **Static Members**: Static variables, methods, and blocks.
  
### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Arrays and ArrayLists**: Declaring and manipulating arrays, using ArrayList for dynamic data storage.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- **HashMap and HashSet**: Implementing key-value pairs and unique elements using hash-based collections.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search and binary search.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive functions (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.).

### Exception Handling

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Handling runtime exceptions using `try-catch`.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating user-defined exception classes.
- **Finally Block**: Ensuring cleanup operations, regardless of exception occurrences.
  
### Advanced Topics

- **Multithreading**: Creating and managing threads using `Thread` and `Runnable`.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring thread safety using synchronization.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, etc.
- **Java Streams**: Using streams for processing data in a functional style.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Using lambdas for concise and readable code.
- **Collections Framework**: Deep dive into collections like `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, and `Map`.
- **Java 8 Features**: Understanding functional interfaces, the `Stream` API, and the new date-time API.
- **GUI Development**: Building simple user interfaces with AWT and Swing.
- **Database Connectivity (JDBC)**: Connecting Java to relational databases (MySQL, SQLite) for data manipulation.

### Design Patterns (Optional)

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects using a factory method.
- **Observer Pattern**: Creating a one-to-many dependency between objects.

Each folder contains Java files dedicated to specific topics, with clear and simple examples for better understanding.

## How to Run the Code
